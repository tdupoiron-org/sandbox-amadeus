This repository contains an efficient implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers up to a given number. The algorithm is implemented in both JavaScript and Python.

## Files

- `app.js`: This file contains the JavaScript implementation of the algorithm. It includes a `listPrimes` function to generate the list of primes and a `main` function to run the program and measure the execution time.

- `app.py`: This file contains the Python implementation of the algorithm. It includes a `list_primes` function to generate the list of primes and a `main` function to run the program and measure the execution time.

## Usage

To run the JavaScript version, use the following command:

```bash
node app.js
